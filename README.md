# Travel Nepal Website

Travel Nepal is a web application that displays information about different travel packages and allows users to book their desired package. The application is built using the Vue Framework and was initially created as an assignment for SIT120. The project was divided into two parts, proof of concepts and the final project, with a written report on the website.

## Features

* Display information about different travel packages and their prices
* Users can browse packages, view their details, and select the one that suits their preferences
* Users can add selected packages to their cart and proceed to checkout
* Display user's current bookings in their dashboard
* Future versions of the application will include the ability to search for packages, view ratings, availability, and other information

## Challenges

* Design of the application: The design of the application was a challenge as it needed to be sophisticated, user-friendly, and mobile-friendly. A lot of research, testing, and tweaking was required to achieve the desired results.
* Transitions and animations: Due to the complexity and frequency of transitions in the project, it was challenging to implement them while keeping the application fast and responsive. Several design decisions and techniques were implemented to overcome this obstacle.
