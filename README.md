This project was an assignment from SIT120 where the project was divided into two parts, proof of concepts and final project. The proof of concepts were paired with a written report on the website where we also had to make user stories, and dabble with the UI/UX for the site. Part 2 was about implementing the proof of concepts using the Vue Framework.

One of the key features of the application was its ability to display information about different packages and their prices. Users could browse the packages, view their details, and select the one that suits their preferences. Once the user had selected a package, they could add it to their cart and proceed to checkout.

Another important feature was the ability to display the user's current bookings. After a user had placed a booking, they could view it in their dashboard. In future versions of the application, users will be able to search for their desired package and see ratings, availability, and other information.

The project faced several challenges, one of which was the design of the application. I had to ensure that the application was sophisticated, user-friendly, and mobile-friendly. This required a lot of research, testing, and tweaking to achieve the desired results.

Another challenge was the inclusion of transitions and animations. Due to the complexity and frequency of transitions in the project, it was challenging to implement them while keeping the application fast and responsive. I had to make several design decisions and implement various techniques to overcome this obstacle.
